# Scout's Fork

This fork is used as a testbed for ScoutAPM instrumentation. We're not adding
any features on this fork, and there's probably no reason for individuals to
install it.

To install your own copy of Firestorm, see the main
[Firestorm](https://github.com/dailydrip/firestorm) repository.
